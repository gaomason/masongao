    <h1>Change</h1>
  <p>I don't think that I've changed that much in the past few years. Or, since I turned, maybe, 13? 14? Let me think of my changes over my entire life. </p>
  <p>I don't think I was sentinent until I moved to Shanghai. Then, as the new kid at school, I was pretty shy, but I made my first friend in Kindergarten. Yoshi. Then, first grade, I don't even remember who I made friends with then. I think they moved away too quickly. Second grade, I made friends with Jefferey. Yeaaah.... I could have remembered my elementary school days a lot better a few years ago, but time has passed. Wow. But, I had a lot of friends in second grade. I do remember that, until third grade, where Concordia decided to put me in a class without any of those friends. That's when my introversion emerged. I think. Was I shy? Or did I just want to be with my old friends? I think that it was more the latter at that time, but I was definitely shy as well. Third grade was not a good year for me. Did I even have friends in that class? I really don't remember. Fourth grade, Mr. Russell. Time of my life.</p>
<p>Ok, anyway, back to my topic. I think I kept changing between being the group leader/unifier of my friends, before being placed in an unknown setting and reverting back to introversion. Happened in third, sixth, and high school. But in high school, I think that reversion became permanent. </p>
  <p> I've been talking to people about whether I've changed since middle school. I don't think so. Not much at least. Definitely more mature. But I'm pretty sure I still think the same. Which is either a good or bad thing: Maybe I never needed to improve myself, my starting foundation was already solid enough. I know that is not true. But yeah, I think becoming more mature solidified my good qualities, and lessened my bad qualities. I've become less... annoying? easy to get mad? In fact, I never get mad anymore. Not true, but I express it in a much more mature way. I think my communication skills definitely improved, which is a big part of my "change".</p>
  <p>Honestly, I'm not sure where I'm going with this. If you put me back in my middle school self's shoes, I definitely would do things differently. But I think that I would still feel the same regarding everything that happened back then. And I think that is the part that defines me. </p>
