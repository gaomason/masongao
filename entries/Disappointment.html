    <h1>Disappointment 12/5/24</h1>
    <p>Our friend group of 6 has been splintered. Austin decided that he hates me, and started to act really resentful towards me. Whenever everyone was together, and I was there, he would just ruin the vibe. In the early days, I could tell that he was trying to exclude me, so I tried extra hard to become better friends with everyone else. And, that worked. I would just act normal, and allow him to destroy himself.</p>
  <p>However, he has started to try to actively attack me, to exclude me. He tried to invite everyone in the group, besides me, to dinner. Was not going to let that slide. I was outraged. Have not seen this scale of 人生攻击since middle school. </p>
  <p>But, I am more disappointed in the guys in the group. I feel that they should be defending me. In my opinion, there is a very clear right and wrong in this situation. I’m the victim here. Yet, they are trying to excuse his actions. They acknowledge that I ‘ve done nothing, yet they still want me to bow to his irrational demands. Honestly, I feel so disappointed in them. I feel that if my two friends are beefing, and there is a clear right and wrong, you have a responsibility to tell the wrong one to stop. They are still your friend after all. But some people are just like that. Passive. They don’t have the backbone to criticize a friend, when criticism is probably the most valuable thing a friend can offer. </p>
  <p>I can’t be good friends with them. Or passive people in general. Cowards. I need to be able to trust that my friends have my back, especially when I am quite clearly in the white. I cannot see grey, especially if grey involves having to hurt myself. Ultimately, they made the decision to hurt me. I can’t be friends with people who would knowingly hurt their friends so that they can stand safely on the sidelines. I guess I value loyalty. A lot.</p>

    <p>I think I've thought about this a little more. I guess, there is a clear victim here, but it is not as clear cut as I thought. I think it is unfair of me to ask them to do that. But also, at the same time, I don't think I will get over feeling disappointed about this. Just who I am as a person. But, the way I think of it, this is something that I probably would do as well: It is more of a ryan - darwin situation rather than a ryan - sam situation. Whoever wins is whoever acts most normal, which I am of course, winning at. They'll hopefully realize that being friends with someone like that is... not optimal. If they don't, I don't really need to be friends with them in the long run. I think this event has opened my eyes a little to personality defects, but I shouldn't act on them. The action is just to wait. and see. </p>
