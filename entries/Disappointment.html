    <h1>Disappointment 12/5/24</h1>
    <p>Our friend group of 6 has been splintered. Austin decided that he hates me, and started to act really resentful towards me. Whenever everyone was together, and I was there, he would just ruin the vibe. In the early days, I could tell that he was trying to exclude me, so I tried extra hard to become better friends with everyone else. And, that worked. I would just act normal, and allow him to destroy himself.</p>
  <p>However, he has started to try to actively attack me, to exclude me. He tried to invite everyone in the group, besides me, to dinner. Was not going to let that slide. I was outraged. Have not seen this scale of 人生攻击since middle school. </p>
  <p>But, I am more disappointed in the guys in the group. I feel that they should be defending me. In my opinion, there is a very clear right and wrong in this situation. I’m the victim here. Yet, they are trying to excuse his actions. They acknowledge that I ‘ve done nothing, yet they still want me to bow to his irrational demands. Honestly, I feel so disappointed in them. I feel that if my two friends are beefing, and there is a clear right and wrong, you have a responsibility to tell the wrong one to stop. They are still your friend after all. But some people are just like that. Passive. They don’t have the backbone to criticize a friend, when criticism is probably the most valuable thing a friend can offer. </p>
  <p>I can’t be good friends with them. Or passive people in general. Cowards. I need to be able to trust that my friends have my back, especially when I am quite clearly in the white. I cannot see grey, especially if grey involves having to hurt myself. Ultimately, they made the decision to hurt me. I can’t be friends with people who would knowingly hurt their friends so that they can stand safely on the sidelines. I guess I value loyalty. A lot.</p>
