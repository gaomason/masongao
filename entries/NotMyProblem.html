    <h1>Not My Problem 17/5/24</h1>
    <p>You know, I think that I am a big believer in standing behind my friends unconditionally. Loyalty. I expect them to do the same. I was thinking of an instance where I did not do that.</p>
  <p>Senior trip, Cabo. I think that somehow, the topic of Kot came up. Wow, what a distant memory. Jason was upset/frustrated because Kot was doing something bad to him. I think she had either kicked him from her friend group's server/group chat, or had muted him. Something like that. He wanted me to retaliate for him, do the same thing to her and her friends, from our group chat.</p>
  <p>I feel like I should have. Honestly, I'm still not sure why I didn't. I'm very much better friends with Jason then Kot. I know that he is (mostly) in the right with their situation. Though, at the time, I didn't want to get involved. Very complicated and messy business. But, he was the better friend, and was mostly in the right. So, why didn't I help him, and kick her out like she did him? Even Eric (her boyfriend, also our friend, said he understood. Everyone understood).</p>
  <p>I think I was too passive. If given the chance to again, knowing Jason, not knowing Kot now, I would do it in a heartbeat. But back then... I think, a part of me, was thinking that if I did this, I would be getting in Kot's bad graces: I didn't want that: Already had heard enough of what happens to those who remained in her bad graces. I was *kind* of friends with her as well. I didn't want to break that friendship, or friendliness, by choosing Jason's side. All that time, I knew that Jason was better, but I still couldn't choose him, I guess.</p>
  <p>I fear that I damaged my friendship with Jason, because of that. I mean, we still get along very well. And there is not much friendship to damage, we see each other like twice a year. Our good feelings remain. But I fear that because of that, I went down a level with him. Because ultimately, I told him: I know you are in the right, but this: "This is not my problem". I should have stood by him then. Kot and I are no longer, were probably never, friends. Looking back, there was nothing to lose. I only lost, perhaps, a little trust from Jason.</p>
  <p>How does this parallel with my Austin situation? I think I more clearly emphasize with them. But at the same time, this situation is still different. I think that a key difference is: Jason was asking me to "harm" someone else for him. (Looking back, there really was not much harm). I didn't want to do such harm. Looking back, I probably should have. But, he was asking me to choose sides. I think that with my Austin case, I am actively asking my friends not to choose sides. I am asking them to not "harm" me. I don't want to be excluded; It would make me upset. Maybe they feel like by including me, they're choosing my side. Does that make sense? I don't know. From my perspective, it really doesn't. How does including everyone mean you're choosing my side? Of course, I want everyone to be included, because that way, I win. I can act like a normal human being around him, but he can't. If he doesn't learn, then I'm happy regardless. But yeah. I don't matter to them, what matters is how they feel, if they're choosing sides. I'm really trying to see it from their perspective, but all I can think of is that they chose Austin's side, by excluding me. I don't get how hard it is for them to see that. There is no harm in them inviting everyone, yet there is harm in them choosing to exclude me. Sigh. 
<p>So, in conclusion. I am still upset at their actions. "Not my problem" is the wrong mindset to pursue: even though different situations, I still regret what I did that time. I perhaps, understand better, the difficulty of this. But again, difficulty is no excuse for such actions.</p>
