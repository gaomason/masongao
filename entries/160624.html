    <h1>16/6/24</h1>
  <p>I am so mfing tired. Having a girlfriend is so. Mfing tiring. I like it so much, but also, this is the first time in a while where I've gotten some alone time agian. But I also miss her at the same time. 10:26 PM right now. I barely get any work done, man! I am so tired, we just enjoy each other's company for hours on time, just cuddling. I love it, but I am... so tired. Need to get work done. I havea 11am meeting with Murphy tomorrow. Need to use this time to get shit done!</p>
  <p>Let me try to recap... Everything that has happened. Sat, june 8th. Made 糯米鸡, told her what she told me made me very conflicted. Sunday, june 9th. I hung out with her, went to... something that day? OHH. Went to the gay parade that day, right? No. That was also saturday. Sunday, I went and had dinner with Kiki. And Mia, updated them on the current happenstance. Then, I went home at night, and I called her because IDK, just wanted to talk to her. And, I just said, if you ever 考虑, and I asked us to try it out right now, what would you say? And she said yes. So, we started to decide to try to date at around 1am, Monday, june 10th. And from then, it has just been a whirlwind. Both of us have progressed in our liking of each other so fast. The physical has increased, but so has the intimacy. And she has gotten much more clingy, which makes me so happy but also tires me. During the week, it has just been... She sometimes sleeps over? She slept over two nights in a row during the week, and we just stay at home and cuddle. Haven't really done many cute, romantic things because. Been busy. With the physical. But planning tos tart again soon. just cooking. The big group of us went to Chinatown yesterday, we acted pretty cute. And today, just stayed at home and cuddled the entire day. Yeah. Also, Angela has a bad opinion of me, intersting. </p>
