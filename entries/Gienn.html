    <h1>Gienn 12/5/24</h1>
    <p>I think Gienn and I don’t understand each other very well. We operate on two different wavelengths when it comes to relationships. But, I know that he won’t do me no harm. There have been quite a few times, where I hear of something that he did, and I think: “Wow, there it is. The bad thing he has done to me.” But each time, after asking him, I realize that it is not. That there is no malice. I really do want to understand him better, but I don’t think I can. But, I trust him a lot. Maybe second only to Jaden. Sophomore year, he has gotten more emo and less fun, and I wish I could have the old Gienn back, but also, I want to be more than just fun friends. I think he lies to himself a lot, and sometimes acts in unsatisfactory ways, but I think that at the end of the day, he is a good person. My only sad thing is that I feel that this year, he wanted to drift farther from me. I think he said so himself at some point. I get it, because we really were attached freshman year. But, I wish I could still rely on him the way I used to.</p>
