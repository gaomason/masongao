    <h1>Jason 12/5/24</h1>
    <p>	Jason does a lot of things differently than I would do. But also, a lot of things similarly. I think that he lies to himself a lot more than I do, and when he does, he truly believes in those lies. But I think we both try to operate in a logic based manner, so I understand him a lot. I think we weren’t that close during high school, but after walks with him, I understand him a lot. I feel he is also, a good person. And like me, recognizes that he does bad, but tries to limit it as much as possible. We aren’t that “close” as friends, but we are at a very comfortable level, where when I return to SD, he is the one person I’ll gladly seek out at anytime. We are at a comfortable distance, but also a close understanding, and I am very happy with our friendship.</p>
