    <h1>Jaden 12/5/24</h1>
    <p>I would trust Jaden with my life. I think that he is the best person I’ve met in my lifetime, he has the most good out of anyone I’ve met, and the least bad. He has supported me through a lot of things. </p>
  <p>	However, sometimes I worry about him still. I worry that I like him a lot whole lot more than he likes me. That he has supported me a whole lot more than I have supported him. That our friendship is still on unequal footing. Also, since college, he has been so busy. I don’t get how he can be so busy, but I’ve gotten used to it. I know he will always be there, but sometimes, it takes a while for him to respond. Again, my worry. I know he is so busy, so I feel like I go try and find him more then he tries to find me. But, I know that is just how life works. When we talk, I realize he is still my closest friend, and nothing changes. Distance and time don’t affect our friendship that much, even if we don’t talk too often, I know he is there.</p>
