    <h1>8/6/24</h1>
    <p>So, it is 12:45 AM right now. I have been (kind) of busy the past few days. I went to my research meeting with my PHD student advisor on Wednesday, basically a two hour lecture on shit that I have no understanding of. Currently trying to understand it, so here is what I need to figure out: </p>
   <ul>
                        <li>The wassterstein metric: HOW IS IT COMPUTED</li>
     <li># push forward operator?</li>
     <li>I know barycenter is the "center" of a set of probability distributions in a metric space, but how tf is that found?</li>
     <li>Yeah.. A lot to figure out.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Ok, but besides that. On thursday, I met with Mcninch, told him I would be busy. Seemed we were on the same page, but things ended on a very good note. I'll probably keep him updated, continue to try to Lean (Provided I'm not too busy). </p>
  <p>I've also. Just. Been busy. Cooking, eating, thinking about what to cook. Getting a bike has made my life exponentially better though. But, I've just been, cleaning, 理东西, hanging out, etc. Buying sm shit, spending sm money. God! But yeah, i'll probably cool down in a while. Besides that... We are out of the woods? Though, today, it wasn't really the craziness, but rather the feelingsish that got me. IDK. I really don't know. About: 考虑一下. This was the first I heard from the other side. Gave a little spark of hope, got me thinking. And still, at this point, idk. I guess i'm not over it. But, I know I won't be hurt at least</p>
  <p>Today, met with Murphy team at 9 am. Also, yesterday night, spent an hour and a half trying to fix my back in the middle of the night. it has been really painful. Hopefully tonight is not the case. Just hungout, tried to do some work today, etc, same same. Not much... Going to pride parade tmr, LOL. Ight, gn.</p>
