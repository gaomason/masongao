    <h1>Teenage Love 13/5/24</h1>
    <p>Wow! Well, I am glad to say that I experienced the so called "Teenage love". Except, it was very clear there was no love involved. Just pure horniness. I must say. I never realized how dangerous teenage love is. How uncontrollable it is. How crazy it makes me feel. I used to look down on people who just gave in to their desires. I think that I semi-successfully faced this demon, and managed to vanquish it - albeit, I have come out with wounds. But, I completely understand how difficult it is to not give in to those desires. Perhaps, I will still give in to those desires. It is an ongoing battle. Like, it is actually the most difficult test of willpower I have faced in my life.</p>
  <p>BUt yeah. Lust is one hell of a drug. And I realize, that my pursuit of love previously, was the pursuit of lust. I just didn't realize it. OK, it was not that dramatic. But I think that now that I have experienced this, I can say that I need to find love first, before I find lust.</p>
  <h2>Teenage love is a sham.</h2>
