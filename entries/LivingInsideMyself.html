    <h1>Living inside myself.</h1>
<p>Everyone always talks about things like, you shouldn't care about what other people say... But in reality, that's what most people care about. Been reading Rousseau, where he talks about living inside oneself versus living outside oneself. From class discussion, seems like it is human nature to live outside oneself to me. It is ingrained within society to care about what others think; That's how a society functions.<\p>
  <p>How does this apply to myself. I like to think that I don't really care about what other people think of me, that indifference is the best choice. But I know that is not true. Why do I want to be a good person? Because I want to be known as a good person. I want to reap the benefits that come with being a good person. A good reputation is a very nice thing to have, I've noticed, which is why I act morally. My virtues, my moral compass, comes from what I think other people would think. </p>
  <p>I think I can say this, and not be exaggerating. But I think there is also another aspect to this. Which is also social, but in a different way. I want to surround myself with good, moral people. And to do that, I must be a good moral person. Why do I want to associate with good, moral people? Because associateting with bad, or even mediocre, people, is a recipe for disaster in my opinion. People that have the potential to hurt you, should not be your friends. I need good, moral friends to live my life the way I want, and to do that, I must be good and moral. </p>
  <p>Thus, that concludes my argument to be a good person. </p>
  <p>I do think that I don't really care about what other people think of me. I definitely do live more within myself than most oher people. But, to people who I care about, my friends, I very deeply care about how they feel about me. So perhaps, that level of emphasis is multiplied, to make up for my indifference towards the general population. I would rather not be known to the general population. Is that true? Maybe I have to be known first, to be able to compare. But in my current state, I do not care much about my reputation, especially among people I deem as bad (And there are many of those). </p>
