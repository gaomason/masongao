    <h1>30/5/24</h1>
    <p>WOW! Officially 20 years old today.</p>
  <p>Yesterday, woke up at 4 30 am. Spent 9 hours on the phone. Just laying around, no energy. Today, I will need to pack, meet with Jesse for lunch, play soccer w Duli (and his friend Nelson), and prepare for my flight tomorrow. Am excited. It is 8:06 AM. May update, may not. We'll see. Just wanted to have an entry for this day, at least.</p>
    <h3>10:04 PM</h3>
    <p>Today is my 20th birthday. I forgot. Am now updating because of that. So, I walked with Panda into the canyon, unleashed. He was very happy, which made me very happy, to see him running around. Then, ate lunch with Jesse, played a ltitle basketball. Was so tired already. Then, played soccer with Duli and Nelson, and some random grad students. I was cooking, thank god, my birthday skills came. But, was so tired. And now, I am so tired. Have been doing a little packing still. But, now, I'm going to go to sleep. In like 25 minutes. Alright, that is my birthday update. Nothing special. Nice day because I'm leaving tomorrow. Can't wait!</p>
