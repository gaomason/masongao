    <h1>30/5/24</h1>
    <p>WOW! Officially 20 years old today.</p>
  <p>Yesterday, woke up at 4 30 am. Spent 9 hours on the phone. Just laying around, no energy. Today, I will need to pack, meet with Jesse for lunch, play soccer w Duli (and his friend Nelson), and prepare for my flight tomorrow. Am excited. It is 8:06 AM. May update, may not. We'll see. Just wanted to have an entry for this day, at least.</p>
