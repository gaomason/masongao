    <h1>Black Book of Grudges</h1>
 <p>This is an entry dedicated to everything I can remember from people that have caused me pain, or just made me rethink my relationship with them.</p>
  <li>Alan and David not inviting me for that Valorant stack after I messaged them</li>
  <li>Allie forgetting about Gienn and I on Halloween night</li>
  <li>Asking Max to join dinner with him and his friend, given the excuse that they were at a two person table, sitting alone after seeing them</li>
<li>Not being included in the "cool" group of people during YangShuo. I completely understood why Darwin did that, that's just Darwin, and it wasn't his fault anyway. Had fun with KJ and Ryan, was probably a better experience</li>
<li>Kayoon ghosting me, or just lying to me. But I think I realized very early on</li>
<li>Gienn making fun of my acne in the group chat. I think that is the first and only time he has done something like that, intentional or not</li>
  <li>Dylan not inviting me to basketball with Thomas and Dean. Then, Ryan and Dylan not inviting me to basketball again with Thomas and Dean. I realized my place within their lives</li>
 <p>From this list, I think I am bothered by friends doing things to me that I would never do to them. Though I was very immature when I was younger.</p>
