    <h1>Love 14/2/24</h1>
  <p>I'm starting to think I'll never find love. Or at the very least, it's going to be a long. long. time.</p>
  <p>I thought I completely was over it. Sigh.</p>
  <p>You know, I know I was influenced by the hormones. I KNOW that. Everything was fake. I kNOW that. I know that she and I do not fit well together. We have wildly different values. I KNOW that. I know that. We are very different people. I am always so broody. She is always so happy.</p>
  <p>I know all of this. Yet. It hurts. Even now, knowing all this. Knowing our incompatiabilty. I think I would still be willing to give things a try.</p>
  <p>She made me feel so content. That ignorant bliss. And, it wasn't just the hormones. She made me feel like she cared about me. That, she somewhat understood me. I think she is probably the first girl that I think, understood me to a degree where I felt validated. There are not many people in this world that I feel understand me. Let alone a girl, that I am attracted to, that has that. </p>
  <p>Why wasn't she willing to give things a try? Because she knew all of this? Why am I still wanting to give things a try, knowing all of this? We have access to the exact same information now. Yet, I am still yearning. Probably because she is not that type of person. Again, we are literally incompatible.</p>
  <p>I know that there is someone out there, who will understand me better. But at this point of my life. It's looking real bleak. I need to get over it.</p>
