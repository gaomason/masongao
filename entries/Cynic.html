    <h1>Cynic</h1>
    <p>I remember in third grade. It was recess time, and my whole class was walking down the stairs. I watched as this guy in my class; I think his name was Jun, opened his snack box, and gave a cookie or something to this girl, Lisa. She was the girl that half the class had a crush on, so I remember very well, watching this interaction and thinking: Wow, that’s another one.</p>
    <p> The feeling that I recall watching them was disgust. Perhaps I was disgusted at myself for not thinking of doing such a thing myself. No. I was more disgusted at the thought behind the action: To buy a girl’s favor using food. </p>
    <p>Maybe Jun was simply being a nice guy and trying to make friends. From my limited memory of him, I do think he was one of the nicer kids in my class. My cynical disposition was apparent, even in third grade.</p>
    <p>I think I just really hate people who kiss ass.</p>
