    <h1>22/5/24</h1>
    <p>Ahh.. So, I've avoided writing the past two days because I've been thinking a lot. And I feel like I thought it through. What have I done the past two days? Well, on the 20th, I was struggling with those thoughts. I think I just lay there and did nothing. I biked to the beach, but didn't really think of much. Just exercise. Yesterday, same same. Yesterday, I was so emo/tired for some reason. IDEK why. I think I was listening to too much sad music. But yeah. I guess I have a few things to write about now. Also, Murphy got back to me: It's unpaid research, with the REU people who are paid. I wonder if I will feel any bitterness/insecurity to them. Probably not, but also, 40 hours a week! WOW! That is basically a job. But, it's flexible, so it'll probably end up being less. Especially since i'm not being paid. But, that shit has also got me nervous. So many things to prepare for. To do. Also need to do lean. Past 3-4 days, I've been unproductive as hell.</p>
