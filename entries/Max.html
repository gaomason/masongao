    <p>Maybe I only consider Max as trustworthy because he understands me, that he thinks highly of me. But, I think that he is a good person that sometimes, goes down the wrong pathway, makes the wrong decision. I like him because he knows to apologize. We have gotten a lot closer and I feel like I can tell him a lot of things, and he will understand. We are at a distance because of just, cultural differences, friend groups, etc, but I do like him a lot. He does make the wrong decisions sometimes, but he is quite self aware. If told, he will readily own up, and that is a personality trait that I am looking for. I think though, that he does make the wrong decisions sometimes. Well, not the wrong decisions. Just not my decisions. I remember that time he wanted to get dinner with mutual accquaintance. Was bummed. But no big deal. I trust him.</p>
