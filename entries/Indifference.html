    <h1>Indifference 13/5/24</h1>
  <p>This is the essay I wrote for my philosophy bad person class. I thought I wrote a pretty good essay. So, here it is!</p>
    <h3>Identify a vice of yours that might lead to moral trouble for someone who is your friend. Why would it still be worthwhile to be friends with you? </h3>
<p>Growing up, I was probably the friend who “cared” the most. I cared about my friends a lot: I organized most of our plans, brought people together, and was generally the “glue” of all the friend groups I’ve had. On the other hand, I also cared about small things. Trivial things. Petty things. I would easily get upset or frustrated at things my friends did that I disagreed with. Although most of these things were minor annoyances that I easily shook off,  there was one thing that I never truly got over: Indifferent friends: The ones who were always at risk of flaking, the ones whom I had to spend the most effort to hang out with, the ones that always seemed to have a level of detachment from our friendship. I couldn’t understand why those friends didn’t care as much as me.</p>

<p>Coming into college, I was tired of being the friend who cared the most, annoyed at small things, and always having friends who seemed to care less about our friendship than I did. I wanted to be on the opposite side of the spectrum, to be that friend who cared the least about things yet still extracted the value of friendship. That led to my adoption of the vice that I will discuss in this essay: indifference.</p>

<p>Let me define what I mean by indifference. The Oxford Dictionary defines indifference as a “lack of interest, concern, or sympathy.” However, I mean something a little bit different. I would describe my vice as the tendency to feign indifference: To act as if I have little interest or concern or to show little emotion about my feelings. Truly indifferent or apathetic people most likely exist, but I am not one of them. Instead, my vice is that I act as such.</p>

<p>Indifference in moderation can be a virtue: The philosophy of stoicism suggests that embracing indifference can foster resilience and inner peace, enabling individuals to maintain a sense of calm and rationality. As mentioned before, I was easily annoyed and would get frustrated with others. Through practicing indifference, I have been able to regulate my emotions better and respond to situations more rationally and effectively.</p>

<p>However, in excess, indifference is harmful. I used indifference as a protection mechanism. In college, where friends have come and gone, I acted indifferent towards my friends so that if they left, I could better regulate my emotions. People want their friends to care about them. But there’s one more level to this care: They want their friends to show they care about them. As an indifferent friend, I know firsthand how my detachment has harmed my friendships by causing misunderstandings and making my friends feel like I barely care about them. As someone who has been friends with many indifferent friends, I know the feeling it causes when it seems your friend cares less than you.</p>

<p>So, while indifference has both its positive and negative aspects, acting indifferent towards your friends undoubtedly damages your friendship and makes it harder to become better friends. Now, I want to examine the more interesting part of this question: How does acting indifferent cause moral risk for your friends?</p>

<p>Is it bad to be friends with an indifferent friend? I want to examine this question through the lenses that Isserow provides in her article.</p>

<p>The Desert View would say that indifferent friends don’t deserve those friendships. Speaking from previous experiences, this is a view that I’ve often agreed with. When it feels like your friend doesn’t value your friendship as much as you do, it makes you feel lousy and makes you question whether it’s your problem or whether that friend deserves your friendship. I’ve often had to spend a lot of effort to convince an indifferent friend to come out and hang out. Though I usually excuse this imbalance of effort to their personality, I have often thought that I should just stop asking them to hang out.</p>

<p>The abetting view provides a similar perspective on this: By being friends with those who act indifferent, we are enabling them to continue to act with indifference. After all, it is not good to treat your friends as if you care less about them: They’re your friends. If you continue to be friends with an indifferent friend, perhaps they will never realize how hurtful and irritating they are by acting in this manner. Or that it’s not OK to treat their friends like that. By continuing to be their friend, they are allowed to continue treating their friends indifferently.</p>

<p>The risk view says that by being friends with someone who acts with indifference, we put ourselves at risk of learning this trait.  I can say this was true for me: I was friends with people who generally acted as if they didn’t care about anything and saw the imbalance of how much they put into their relationships versus how much they got out of those relationships. I was tired of being the one who always put more in, so I adopted an apathetic attitude to emulate them and reap the benefits of my future friendships.</p>

<p>The moral priorities view that Isserow argues for is the most forgiving. While acting indifferent towards your friends may be bad, it isn’t that bad. Most people excuse far worse qualities in their friends: What harm does a little detachment in your friend do, especially if they have many redeeming qualities? This view is what most people agree with. Everyone has a few indifferent friends, and they remain friends with them despite their behavior.</p>

<p>Again, as the moral priorities view argues, indifference is not that bad. It certainly is one of the lesser moral vices, if it can even be considered one. However, these views overlook the actual danger that comes with being friends with an indifferent friend. I want to introduce another risk view: the riskier view. Acting indifferent might lead to moral trouble for your friends because it may lead them to engage in a cycle of moral complacency.</p>

<p>What do I mean by this cycle of moral complacency? I mean that by acting indifferent, making it seem as if you don’t care about anything, you put your friends at risk of inadvertently mistreating you. As the indifferent friend, when this happens, you just brush it off and act as if you aren’t bothered by it. This leads to a cycle where your friends do worse and worse things while you keep brushing it off.</p>

<p>I have a personal example of this. When I came to college, I was part of a friend group where I was known as the chill friend, the friend who “doesn’t care.” At first, I reaped the benefits of indifference: I was no longer the organizer or the glue. Little things I didn’t agree with didn’t bother me. I kept a sense of detachment while still extracting the benefits of friendship. My social life was easy and peaceful.</p>

<p>However, soon, my indifference became a problem. When I acted as if I wasn’t bothered by little things, my friends never noticed what they were doing. Soon, those little things escalated into more and more severe problems. Soon, I found myself brushing off things I should have cared about.</p>

<p>I have an Android phone, but my friends all have iPhones. Inevitably, they created an iMessage group chat without me so that it was “easier for everyone.” I kept up the facade for a while, acting as if I didn’t care that I was being excluded from the group chat. After all, I am not that social. I’ve never cared for group chats. The group chat wasn't a big deal as long as I was friends with them in person.</p>

<p>I had gotten by before because my good friends in the group had let me know what was going on in the chat. However, the cycle kept going. Before, it was just a group chat. But slowly, I became excluded or forgotten from other things.</p>

<p>Eventually, I couldn’t bottle my feelings up anymore. I saw that my friends were treating me differently than they should have. By that point, it had gone on long enough, and the way that they had treated me made me feel resentful. I no longer wanted to be friends with most of them.</p>

<p>What is the point of my example? I want to show how being friends with someone who acts indifferent may put you at risk of treating them improperly. After talking to them after this drama occurred, the same excuse kept coming up. When/if they realized that they were treating me badly as a friend, they thought it was OK because “I didn’t care”.</p>

<p>Is it immoral to engage in immoral actions if the affected person honestly doesn’t care? That is another question for another essay, but I would argue it is because you still engage in immoral actions. You put yourself at risk of continuing to do those immoral actions to people who do care.</p>

<p>Thus, being friends with an indifferent person may put you at risk of acting immorally towards them. As an apathetic person, I also bear the responsibility that I was morally complicit in how they treated me immorally. I never said I took issue with what was happening until it was too late; I acted like it was fine: I gave my friends a platform to continue acting immorally towards me. It’s your responsibility, as a friend, to tell your friends if what they’re doing is wrong, especially if it is wronging you.</p>

<p>So, these are the ways in which being friends with an indifferent friend may lead to moral trouble.</p>

<p>Now, I am going to answer: why would it be worthwhile to be friends with me despite my indifferent attitude? First, I’ll talk about why it is worthwhile to be friends with me due to my indifferent attitude.</p>

<p>As discussed before, my indifference allows me to approach situations rationally. I always aim to regulate my emotions well and rarely get angry or frustrated. I am also quite honest and straightforward, as there is usually nothing I care about that would prevent me from being honest.</p>

<p>If we’re going back to the moral priorities view, I think I have many redeeming qualities. In fact, despite my indifferent attitude, I would say that my best redeeming quality is that I care too much. I know exactly what it feels like to care too much. Even though I have adopted a lot of indifferent tendencies, I have made sure not to adopt the ones that made me the most frustrated. One of my goals in life is to never “wrong” my close friends. I want never to make them feel like they’ve been excluded, to never flake on them, and never to neglect them because I know exactly what it feels like when that has happened to me. While that goal may be idealistic, I try my best to achieve it. When/if I have done wrong to my friends, I immediately try to fix myself so that it doesn’t happen again. So, despite my feigned indifference, it is worthwhile to be friends with me because once you get past my barrier of indifference, you’ll find that I care—a lot.</p>

<p>Having experienced intense passion and indifference, I've understood that the key lies in how and when these qualities are employed, or they can quickly turn into vices. Passion has made me a good friend and influenced my emotions too much. Indifference has offered me emotional protection but has hindered my ability to be a supportive friend. My experiences have underscored the significance of finding an equilibrium between passion and indifference to nurture healthy and moral friendships.</p>
