    <h1>Chess 16/5/24</h1>
  <p>I played some more Chess today. I am really bad at Chess. I think that Chess really makes me unreasonably angry, it has always been this way. Why? Well, I know I am quite talented at Chess. I picked it up quite early, and would say that I learned the tactical aspect of Chess quite early on. However, at the same time: I am very untalented at Chess. I would say that I am within top 10% of those who play chess. Probably the top 1% of all humans, if they played chess. However, the gap between me and the ~0.01% is simply huge. I don't have that type of talent, and that frustrates me. But then again, it is still possible to succeed in Chess, even without that type of talent. However, I also don't possess the type of work ethic in order to succeed in Chess. Never have. To reach a level higher than mine, it simply becomes pure memorization, and that is something I find boring af. So, I have just plateued. Chess is just chess to me.</p>
  <p>I think I get unreasonably angry at Chess, especially if I lose, because I've felt that it is an intellectual representation of myself. And I know that there are many people, not as talented, that can beat me at chess. So, my work-around to that is just that: it isn't an intellectual representation: Sure, it can tell how "not dumb" someone is. But it doesn't tell how smart they are. Just like standardized tests. </p>
