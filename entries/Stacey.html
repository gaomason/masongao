    <h1>Stacey 12/5/24</h1>
    <p>The first girl on this list! I really do like Stacey. She cares for her friends a lot, notices things, and is happy all the time. She also is capable of thinking things through. But, I think that she doesn’t use that capability nearly enough. Or, that she is too “lazy” to. I know that she won’t actively do harm, but she is easily complicit. I think that she is the first friend on this list I can list passivity as a trait, even though it may be only slight. Not sure if I’m just overlooking it because of stuff, or if I have just accepted it. I do worry about the complicity though, quite a lot. I would say that her status on this list is still. Quite shaky. I like her because she also knows to apologize. The only problem is that even with apologies, she may keep on doing bad. I don’t know if I can accept that, but so far, I have. I really do value our friendship, we can talk about anything I feel like. But, I don’t understand her mindset at times, how she is able to think, but at the same time, engage in unthinking actions. I hope that she remains on this list because I really do like her and want to trust her. </p>
