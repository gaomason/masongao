    <h1>18/5/24</h1>
<p>I missed a day! (Yesterday). So, let me try to recap. Yesterday, I... woke up in a funk. Didn't want to do anything. So i didn't do anything. Lol. I think I just wasted around until 5? Yeah, seems about right. Then, I went to play soccer with Duli. Was pretty fun. Then came home, slept. Today was basically the same. Still kind of in a funk. I really didn't do much today. I figure I will probably do more tomorrow. I went and played more soccer with Duli, got dinner with him. I guess I am meeting new people, or getting to know old people better. Duli is actually pretty chill, I can talk with him. Pretty nice. Soccer was not that good. Pickup type people. Actually could talk about semi-deep stuff with Duli, surprising. Felt comfortable talking to him. Besides that... I am having lunch with Jesse tomorrow! Finally!! Somebody I can talk to!!! A friend is finally back in town. I can't wait. When I recieved his text that he was back, my heart actually skipped a beat. I was so happy, lol. I think that. Tomorrow, I'm gonna go workout before lunch. Then, have lunch, till like 3 ish, come home, do work until I sleep. Then, Monday, I will hopefully go bike to the beach. Duli wants to play more soccer during the weekdays, but I'm not so sure I am that committed. We'll see. I want to bike and do more cardio, which includes soccer. Also, want to workout... So many things. It is 11:12 PM. I almost forgot today as well. Not much has happened. I'm just 发呆这两天. </p>
