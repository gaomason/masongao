    <h1>Teo 12/5/24</h1>
    <p>I trust that Teo wants to do no harm. But I think that he acts in ways that inadvertently do harm. Especially since college, he has changed. During high school, he was my closest friend in SD. He was a better person than me, probably the best person I knew then. But he has changed, and we’ve grown apart. I don’t get how he changed, but I’m not surprised that he has changed in the way he has changed. We’re too far apart now to be good friends.</p>
