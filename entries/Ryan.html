    <h1>Ryan 12/5/24</h1>
  <p>I know Ryan is fundamentally, a good person. However, same worries as Jaden, however, I know my worries are true. We are both just busy with life, and don’t have enough time for each other. Him especially: He has a lot more friends than I do, so while he may be 1/8 for me, I know I am probably 1/30 for him. But, I am comfortable in that arrangement. I know I can talk to him anytime, our friendship has plateaued at this comfortable level, where distance and time doesn’t affect our relationship.</p>
