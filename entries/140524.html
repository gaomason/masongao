    <h1>14/5/24</h1>
    <p>It is 12:30 right now. I have woken up, eaten breakafast, and have done some lean. Need to buy plane tickets. Also, just... IDK, really. Just, been chilling I guess. Feeling a LOT less emo than yesterday. I got sent a few strange messages today, and they didn't make me feel strange. So that is nice. In fact, it made me 想通even more. So! Going to eat lunch soon. Watching You S2 now. Uhh... What else. Still thinking bout stuff. </p>
    <h3>10:12 PM</h3>
    <p>OK. Did some more work, watched some more You, watched some NBA, took a 1.5 hour nap. I really have been sleep deprived from the past 2-3 weeks, maybe month, of college. Like, really, really, sleep deprived. Damn. It all started that one night. Anyway. I biked to the beach today. Sat for around 20 minutes, just watching the waves. Listening to the tide. It was very peaceful. Very relaxing. Very healing? IDK. But I don't feel that emo today. So that is good. I think I'm going to go to the beach and do that more often. Appreciate nature. Anyway... Going to stretch, then sleep.</p>
