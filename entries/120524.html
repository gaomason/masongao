    <h1>12/5/24</h1>
    <p>It is now summer! I am going to be trying to refresh this website of mine. What did I do today? Let me think... Woke up at 8. Ate breakfast. Then, went to buy flowers for mother's day. Then, gave them to said mother. Lay around until 1130, went to Home Depot and HMart with mother, got in-n-out for lunch. Lay around in the afternoon, at 3 got super sleepy, slept until 430, went to gym at 5. Gymed til 615, came home, ate dinner, watched NBA, showered, stretched, and now I am here. It is 10:30. Going to sleep once I finish updating this website.</p>
