    <h1>Depression 14/2/24</h1>
  <p>我很会吃苦。I think that is a big part of me. I don't know if I could ever get depressed. I feel like Life is too short to waste away.</p>
  <p>The closest I've gotten to depression was during high school. But even then, it wasn't depression. It was more of an anger towards the world. Why did I have to move. Why are there no people in the US that I want to be friends with. Why does everyone just talk about school. Why can't my parents see how unhappy they made me. Why are people here such bots. Your typical pubescent thoughts. But, I'm pretty sure I kept most of these thoughts to myself, and this resulted in a depressive exterior fueled by a hateful interior. At that time, I didn't even realize how unhappy I was. Well, I knew that I was unhappy, but even then, it never occured to me that I could be depressed. I still did my day to day tasks, and I still looked towards the future. And the future arrived, and now I know that it was worth it. My happiness state now, while I may not even be happy now (though I am pretty damn happy at the time of writing), cannot even compare with what I was like in high school. It took me coming to college to realize how much better my life became. </p>
<p>I think that I could think of it as an exponential. During high school, I was probably at a 3-4/10. I thought that was pretty normal. Then, coming to college, I realized the scale was out of 100. So in reality, I was at a 3/100. And even then, I never once wanted to kill myself. Or be depressed, you know.</p>
  <p>Though a lot of this is thanks to Panda. I think that he kept me alive during high school. Maybe literally. I'm not sure what I would do if I didn't have him. Which is why I have to take care of him. He was the only one I had during high school. And he is a DOG. LOL. I think that is a testament to my level of life during high school. </p>
  <p>Yeah. Life moves on. If you don't move with the river, you'll be swept away.</p>
