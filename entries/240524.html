    <h1>24/05/24</h1>
    <p>So, I have still been unproductive as hell. Yesterday, woke up... Went shopping with mother and grandmother, at Convoy. Was pretty nice. I also researched and talked about situationships. Thought about that for a while in the morning... Or the night before. But not much. But I realized, what a situationship really is. Then... The rest of the day? I don't know. What did I do....I really don't know. I think I just chilled, browsed Ikea (Like always)? Oh, yesterday, I also watched, the boy who harnessed wind, before I slept. Very, very good movie.</p>
  <p>Today, I finished buying (most) of the stuff I need for move in. Oh, I also woke up today to dispute fridge cleaning. I also emailed McNinch (finally). And, did a little algebra (About time). OH YEAH!!! I crossed 50k today, 10x today!!! What a milestone. Yeah, I feel a brief a sense of acomplishment. This afternoon... Still not much. Still very unproductive. Oh, I also did a little bit of lean. Have been researching more about it. Then, went to play soccer with Duli. Soccer was mid, the quality there was good, but my quality was terrible. After, got dinner with him. Duli is actually very nice to talk to. A shame that I'm only here one more week. But, making friends is hard. å“Ž.</p>
  <p>We talked bout a lot of stuff. Mostly drama/tea of concordia. Went from 530 - 10. Was fun. But, for some reason, now I am feeling a little. Emo. Sigh. Idk. Not even emo. I just feel so alone in this world. It is now exactly 11:30. Luka gamewinner today WCF game 2. Watched that, was great.</p>
  <p>I feel so alone in this world. More than usual.</p>
