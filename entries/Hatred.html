    <h1>Hatred 12/5/24</h1>
    <p>Because of this Austin saga, I think that I felt hatred for the first time in a long, long time. I can’t be wasting my time on hatred.</p>
  <p>I really don’t want to hate anyone. I think that at times, I’ve felt the tingling of hatred for the things that Austin has done to me, or has done to the whole group. Ultimately, I put it as just an immaturity. He needs to grow up and realize what he is doing is not sustainable. In fact, as a former friend, I still remain sort of invested in helping him realize that. Which is again, why I feel more disappointment in my other friends, compared to the slight resentment I felt for Austin, for this entire saga.</p>
  <p>If he keeps going down this road, he’ll eventually destroy himself. I don’t need to do anything.</p>
