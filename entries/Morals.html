    <h1>Morals 16/2/24</h1>
  <p>If a friend cheated on their girlfriend, would you stop being friends with them? That is a question that I have been subject to many times. My answer is always: First, I am not friends, good friends, with anybody that would cheat on their significant other. How do I know they'll never cheat? Because I've already judged them to be good people. Does my judgement sometimes fail? Yes, but in this case, where you've known someone and seen someone for so long, you can't even think of the unthinkable. I know it's naive, but I have absolute trust in my long term judgement. Ok, but even if they did. Then I would stop being friends with them. That just meant my judgement was wrong. I don't want to be around someone like that.</p>
  <p>I know that there are some people who think otherwise. If they didn't know the girlfriend, why should they stop being friends? I think that </p>
