    <h1>5/6/24</h1>
    <p>So Uh. A lot has happened within the past 6 days. Let me think. Friday, I travel to boston, not much happens. Saturday, I spend the entire time moving in. It is really tiring. Was on 5 hours of sleep. Moved in the morning, then went to get groceries in the afternoon, then came home, moved in more, got more groceries, then went to "party", was tired as hell. The entire day, I was kind of frustrated, but also was thinking: 0% is possible. But, then, the night came. I missed the bus. TWICE. 1230 and 130 bus. fucking hell. </p>
  <p>When I missed the 130 bus, I was just. Thinking. The universe is against me. I'm tired of fighting it. So, that night, I gave in. And the next day. I almost fully gave in. The only reason I didn't was because I didn't have the presence of mind to buy them. Then, the next day, I kept on continuing. Before, fully waking up. Realizing I relapsed. So, back to trying to go back to 0%. I know it is a very toxic cycle. But this will be the last cycle. I am more and more awake now. It was fun while it lasted, but it isn't who I want to be.</p>
  <p>Yesterday, I talked to Erica about it. Haha. Fun talk. Also, bought a bike yesterday, bought so many things yesterday. And, realized that 0% is definitely possible. But also, am questioning if 20% is realistic. Because that seems fun, and not that bad. We'll see. I need to think about it more. I am. Really, really, really, really, conflicted. But yeah, the past few days have just been. A whirlwind.</p>
  <p>Today, I am starting my research. So, I will be more busy, and have less time to think about things like this. Haha! </p>
