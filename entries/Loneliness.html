    <h1>Loneliness 24/5/24</h1>
    <p>I read somewhere a few weeks ago: After a certain IQ score, life becomes hell. I have thought about that a lot. Oh, how bliss would ignorance be? I think I realized how lonely I was: High school. yeah. And it has really, really, gotten worse. Especially this year. Jaden got a girlfriend, if he wasn't distant already. Gienn dealing with his own shit, can't talk to him anymore. Max, we are not close enough. Jason, I haven't seen him in too long.. Yeah. And what has happened recently. I just want people that will be there for me. I think I have been struggling with this loneliness for a long time now.</p>
  <p>So, why does life become hell after a certain IQ score? Personally, I think it is because you realize: There are so little people in this world who are able to be your type of person. And it is so difficult to find such people.</p>
