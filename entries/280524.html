    <h1>28/5/24</h1>
<p>Ok, so I have gotten a little worse at doing "daily" entries. Let me try and recount, what I've done these past 3 days (A whole lotta nothing).</p>
  <p>It is currently 3:22 PM. I will go play ball for the last time with Jesse in 37 minutes.</p>
  <p>So, what have I done.. On Saturday, I went and worked out? And just rested. I was really sore after Soccer. Oh, and I started to do some Real 2. I tried both Baby Rudin, and Tao's analysis. I like Tao's better, but also realizing that reading textbooks is actually somewhat fun - I like analysis. I think that I will try to dedicate ~an hour to doing that a day - just academic stuff outside of research. Ambitious, I know, but if it's something I find interesting, I may achieve it. I am kind of skimping on algebra, mostly cuz I don't find it as interesting. Maybe I will check out textbooks for my other 2 classes too.</p>
  <p>Besides that, I just recieved an email from McNinch in response. He seems kind of un committed. Honestly, I have no idea what I'm going to be doing with him. Good thing I have this Murphy thing. Because, it seems there is no clear direction that this Lean thing can go. It was kind of interetsing, but there is so much effort involved in it. Anyway, my plan is to just do it for a while, see how it goes. If I realize its a sham, I'll just thank him for helping me. And then focus on Murphy, hopefully. But, the past few days, I have done very little in terms of studying up on research materials.</p>
  <p>I just finished watching Dune 2. The dune universe is actually pretty interesting, I can see why it gets compared to like LOTR. But, again, the writing that I read, was horrendous. Also just bought 50 bucks worth of clothes. Spent way too long, again, on deciding what to buy.</p>
  <p>Hmm. What else have I done? Oh, on Sunday, played soccer again with Duli, was fun. Think I'm getting better and better. And, yesterday, I did a "full" leg workout, it's my lower back. I think that it helped a little. </p>
  <p>I guess, I'm just preparing to go back. OH! Also, am trying to plan my august stuff. I realize I will probably have to pay for my own ticket ~1000 $ bucks, which I have, but I am trying to find a way to make that myself. Probably stocks, but all my money is illiquid right now. Fuck lithium! I need cash to gamble! But, my current (optimal plan would be): A week back here, then 1 week visiting taiwan/hk, then 1 week shanghai, then 1 week trip, 1 week shanghai, come home, 1 week, then go back to boston, chill for 3-4 days. After I finish writing this, I will try to rethink this plan. Anyway... Yeah.</p>
  <p>Not much has happened. My birthday is in 2 days. Haha! 20 years old. No longer a teenager. Time has passed by so fast. </p>
