    <h1>Kindness</h1>
  <p>I used to think that kindness did not exist in this world. As someone who only thinks for themselves, I know that I am not a kind person. That is why it was so hard for me to wrap my head around the idea that people do good things for each other, without any ulterior motives.</p>
  <p>I think that the first kind person that I realized was truly kind was a girl in my middle school, Elie Wang. She was regarded as the nice girl, the person that everyone liked and who was nice to everyone. Throughout middle school, I was quite distrustful of her. I kept looking for cracks in the facade, any sign that there was something else behind that kindness. At some point, maybe I looked too long and got tired, maybe I matured, but I came to the conclusion that she was truly just nice. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there was something behind that. But, we'll probably never know. </p>
  <p>She was the first person I recognized as truly kind. Are there many more people I know that are truly kind? Let me think.</p>
  <p>Jaden. Lydia? I don't think I've known her long enough to say that. Perhaps Ryan, but I haven't seen him enough in recent years to determine that. I used to think that Teo was a kind person, but he has changed. Maybe he was never kind. Or maybe he just changed. </p>
  <p>Yeah, kindness is quite rare, at least from my perception. There are plenty of nice people, but I feel like I can see through the cracks. In fact, I feel like I am more prone to distrusting nice people, because such people often have the most cracks showing. </p>
  <p>Also, when I say kindness, I mean like 真心. You know. And I'm not counting people who are barely sentinent. I'm talking about kindness as somebody being an intelligent human being, knowing that they should look out for themselves, and despite that, still being kind. All in all, I think that the combination of kindness and intelligence is very rare. Add in extroversion to that, and it becomes nigh impossible to find.</p>
