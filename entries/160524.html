    <h1>16/5/24</h1>
    <p>Ah.. Woke up. Called Max Hodin for a while. Went to gym. Came home. Learned to make 蛋炒饭. Spent 4-5 hours at the desk doing.. Some algebra, some lean (I'm stuck), some online shopping at ikea, some watching youtube, etc... I am so bored today. No You to watch, as I don't want to waste anymore time. Maybe I should just.. Keep watching. Not sure. Was so boring. Then, learned to make 糖醋排骨. Then, walked dog. NBA so boring today. Ah.. At least my stocks are doing well. But yeah. Today was the first boring day of my summer? That is nice to know. It is 8:15 PM. I will attempt to do some more lean (maybe), write a little bit more, 发呆, then sleep. Soccer tomorrow! Something to look forward to.</p>
