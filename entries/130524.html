    <h1>13/5/24</h1>
    <p>Feeling a little down today. My stocks are doing well today, sold CROX calls for 2k, but am unclear how that will pan out. Not sure if i'm missing something there. Woke up, ate breakfast, wrapped dumplings, got Panda from groomer. Then, I've just been laying around again. Finished You S1. It is now 4:15, I plan to stretch and go for a run at around 5. I also started the natural numbers game for research. Seems pretty fun. </p>
  <p>I am feeling a little down today. I had a call, where I realized that this is truly the end of an ignorant bliss. No more canoodling. I think that I thought it'd continue this summer, but think that it is best that I use these 3 weeks to properly recuperate. So, I am feeling a little down. Scrolling through emo reels, but it isn't too bad. I need to clear my head. Too much down time (haha, both meanings) has caused me to think about things a little more. Probably too much more. </p>
