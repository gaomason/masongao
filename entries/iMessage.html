    <h1>iMessage 12/2/24</h1>
  <p>Am I bothered by my lack of iMessage? Not at all. I don't think I've ever felt compelled to switch to an iPhone because I could then use iMessage. My philosophy is that if I am good enough friends with somebody, there are other ways to communicate with them. If we're not good enough friends, than there is no reason to communicate: If they want to find me, they can find me without using iMessage.</p>
  <p>I think that this philosophy of mine has been tested again and again ever since I've come to college. My 'friend' group has an iMessage group chat that I am not a part of. In order to do things with them, to find out what is happening, third parties usually have to tell me about it. I do find that pretty annoying, it causes lots of minor inconveniences. But, my philosophy has held true. I don't consider everyone in that group chat as good friends, or sometimes even friends (depending on definition), and for good reason. Of the group that I am good friends with, I still keep up to date through other methods. I talk to Gienn, Max, Mia, Kiki, through non iMessage methods. Everyone else? Not important.</p>
  <p>I do get the feeling of exclusion that iMessage creates. Do I blame Apple? No. iMessage has been a great filtering method for me, honestly. If the excuse to keep someone from being in a group chat is them not having iMessage, they probably shouldn't be in the group chat anyway.</p>
  <p>Hmm. Looking back on this text I've written, perhaps I sound bitter, slightly. I do think so, that I am bitter. But again. My problem is not with iMessage. Rather with people who use their blue bubbles to justify exclusion. Do I have a problem with exclusion? Yes, but that is a topic for another entry.</p>
