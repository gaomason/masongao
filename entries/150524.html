    <h1>15/5/24</h1>
    <p>Is this going to be a daily thing? IDK. We shall see. I have a lot of time over the summer I guess. Went shopping today, bought some more clothes. WOW! Fashion! Such avarice. Well! Besides that... Came back, did some more lean. Did 1.5 worlds of lean today. Not sure what else... Bought my plane ticket back to boston. During the afternoon... I was planning to go gym, I in fact went, but too late: It was packed. Got to go much earlier, before 3, to beat the school and work crowd. I am still sore from 3 days ago. Will go tomorrow. It is 9:21 now. I will probably do a little more work. Then, go to bed. Feeling a little down at the moment, but nothing major. Much less worse than 2 days ago. But, I haven't really thought about it today. Think I should add some more stuff in thoughts. What else.. Nothing else.</p>
