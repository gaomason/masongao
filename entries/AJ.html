    <h1>AJ 2/2/24</h1>
    <p>There is this guy, AJ, that I am going to be living with for Junior year of college. I am friendly with him, but we are not friends. He is just not my cup of tea, nothing wrong with that.</p>
  <p>I've thought about this a lot. He used to be in my group of "friends", as in, a lot of my friends were friends with him.</p>
  <p>That isn't the case anymore though. Since sophomore year started, they've intentionally distanced themselves away from him. I think I disagree with their actions.</p>
  <p>On one hand, I completely understand. There is a reason why he is not my cup of tea: He is just a "loud" person. Again, nothing wrong with that. However, watching these friends of mine, intentionally leave him out of things, talk behind his back, act like middle schoolers in a sense; It leaves a bad taste in my mouth.</p>
  <p>I think that is one reason as to why I cannot get any closer to this group of friends. I mean, during freshman year, AJ was probably one of their closest friends. How you treat your friends is a great way to tell as to how you live your life. I can't be good friends with people who treat their friends like that.</p>
