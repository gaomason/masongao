    <h1>Dylan 12/5/24</h1>
  <p>	I considered Dylan a trustworthy/close friend at some point, but not anymore. I think I always suspected him of it. But I still do care for him a lot, and I know he cares for me a lot as well. Shit happens, weâ€™ve just grown apart. Though, I always saw it happening. In all honesty, he has not been that good of a friend to me. As in, I know for a fact that I've put in a lot, a lot, a lot, more effort into our friendship than him.</p>
